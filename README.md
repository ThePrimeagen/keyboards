## Motivation
I type everyday of the week.  For five of those seven days, i type for about 6-7 hours.
It makes sense, removing my will for complacency, that i switch to a more efficient keyboard, if there is one.
I present to you, Real Programmers Dvorak.

## Why Dvorak?
Dvorak comes on evey major OS.

## Why change programmers Dvorak?
The major problems around PD is that it has a poorly thought out symbol layout.

* (, ), {, }, [, ]
** The opening and closing symbols are oddly placed.  It makes so much more sense that finger used to open is the same finger on the closing hand.
